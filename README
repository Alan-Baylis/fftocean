The project is only available for MacOS users AT THE MOMENT. Some changes will come
to make it run on both Linux and Windows platforms.

I wrote the project in french, so you may not understand some directories names or
file names. I'm working on the translation of the whole sourcecode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find the following directories :
   - Affichage : GUI of the project, creates a window, deals with the keyboard etc
   - FFT : my own implementation of the Cooley-Tuckey algorithm, for scientific 
           purposes. This can be replaced by using CUDA library.
   - Ocean : classes that are specific to the project

You can find both the classes Camera (to move over the water with the Z, Q, S, D
keys) and Affichage (to provide the GUI) in my repositories.

Feel free to leave any comment about the project, or if you want to improve it.
