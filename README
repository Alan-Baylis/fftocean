Project : FFT-Ocean
Author : DEISS Olivier
Last update : 12/22/2014

This project is a basic implementation of J. Tessendorf's paper :
http://graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/rendering/2005/jdewall/tessendorf.pdf

Language : C++
Libraries : OpenGL, Glut

The project is only available for MacOS users AT THE MOMENT. Some changes will come
to make it run on both Linux and Windows platforms.

I wrote the project in french, so you may not understand some directories names or
file names. I'm working on the translation of the whole sourcecode.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find the following directories :
   - Affichage : GUI of the project, creates a window, deals with the keyboard etc
   - FFT : my own implementation of the Cooley-Tuckey algorithm, for scientific 
           purposes. This can be replaced by using CUDA library.
   - Ocean : classes that are specific to the project
